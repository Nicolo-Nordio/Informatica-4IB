        <h2 id="section1">1. ONE PIECE</h2>
        <img class="image" src="./img/One_Piece.jpg" alt="Immagine 1">
        <p>
            One Piece, so far the longest-running Shonen anime of all time. One Piece first started airing in October
            1999 and is still ongoing. That is a staggering number of years, and even over this massive time period, it
            has not fallen too far in terms of popularity.
        </p>
        <p>
            The story revolves around Luffy, a teen who dreams to become the King of Pirates by finding the treasure
            known as, you guessed it, One Piece. Luffy finds himself his merry band of misfits known as the Straw Hat
            Pirates and heads off to look for his treasure. The power system of this anime is dominated by mysterious
            fruits called Devil Fruits.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is as simple as it could be, eating a Devil Fruit grants the user with magical powers. Some fruits grant
            the power to have the superhuman ability, like Luffy, who can stretch his body like rubber. Some provide the
            power to turn a part of one’s body into animals like the reindeer-like Tony Tony Chopper. And some give the
            ability to control a part of nature by transforming one’s body into a natural element in a certain way.
        </p>
        <p>
            One Piece probably has the most unique animation style and character design from the other two in the Big
            Three. This is an anime that will last you ages with close to a thousand episodes which include fillers as
            well. Definitely not the one you can binge-watch in one go, in fact, it will probably take a lot of patience
            to start. But once you do, the show will take you places you didn’t know existed.
        </p>
        <p>
            One Piece is the most financially successful out of the three. With its estimated income being close to $20
            Billion. This would include about $528 Million for the anime and $8 Billion for the manga magazine alone.
            Merchandise, collected volumes and video games also add up to this already staggering figure to take it to
            the next level. It is also worthwhile to mention that Eiichiro Oda, the creator of One Piece, has a net
            worth of $200 million. This is well deserved because the creator has been working hard for years in a row
            now.
        </p>

        <h2 id="section2">2. BLEACH</h2>
        <img class="image" src="./img/Bleach.jpg" alt="Immagine 2">
        <p>
            The second show in the prestigious Big Three is Bleach. Bleach has one of the most efficient fighting styles
            in all of anime. The characters use swords called Zanpakuto and duel to the death. But it’s not as simple as
            that. The story revolves around Ichigo Kurosaki, a teen who can interact with spirits.
        </p>
        <p>
            His life flips around when he meets Rukia Kuchiki, a soul reaper who sends lost souls to Soul Society
            (Bleach’s iteration of Heaven.) Soul Reapers are beings who are no longer alive and exist as souls only.
            They also exterminate corrupt souls called Hollows and purify them. Rukia comes to Ichigo’s rescue as he and
            his family get attacked by a Hollow.
        </p>
        <p>
            Injured, she staggers on her way to victory, and her only option is to transfer all her powers to Ichigo.
            Doing exactly that, she turns Ichigo into a soul reaper. He proceeds to exterminate the hollow and save his
            family, but it is not the end. A lot occurs, and Ichigo gets to keep the powers given to him by Rukia.
        </p>
        <p>
            The show has some great arcs and storylines. The Bleach power system works on Spiritual Pressure, which
            comes to individuals naturally. The basic rule is that soul reapers with higher spiritual pressure will have
            a larger sword. Ichigo struggles to adapt to his powers initially but finds his way with guidance from a
            former soul reaper, Kisuke Urahara. This show is perfect for an exciting binge-watch as it has fast-paced
            action. It does not give a whole lot of time to philosophical debate like Naruto. Characters introspect and
            look at their inner choices, but when swords are drawn, the battle goes on with few words.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bleach aired from October 2004 to March 2012. The Bleach anime made over $26 Million in its run of eight
            years. Apart from that, Bleach also saw massive sales for the Shonen Jump magazine and merchandise, with the
            former being $6 Billion and the latter over $260 Million. This brings Bleach’s total income to around $7
            Billion. Tite Kubo, the creator of Bleach, has a net worth of $50 Million.
        </p>

        <h2 id="section3">3. NARUTO</h2>
        <img class="image" src="./img/Naruto.jpg" alt="Immagine 3">
        <p>
            If you like fantasy shows with unique magical abilities combined with a world of Ninjas, this one is the
            perfect show for you. Naruto tells the story of an orphaned boy who is looked down on by society. Naruto
            grows up alone and with a few people for comfort. He doesn’t know anything about his parents.
        </p>
        <p>
            He also doesn’t know that he has an evil fox spirit sealed inside of him. The Nine-Tailed Fox wreaked havoc
            in the Hidden Leaf Village ages ago. The 4th Hokage sealed this spirit inside Naruto to stop it from doing
            any more damage. As a result, the village was saved, but Naruto didn’t have any chance of having a normal
            childhood. This is an extremely popular show for its character strength and Naruto being the most Shonen
            protagonist ever. The power system of the Naruto world is called Chakra, it is what powers the Shinobi’s
            attacks and defenses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Better known as Jutsu. The system is not very different from the Dragon Ball Z system of Ki. The greater the
            chakra, the stronger the shinobi. Naruto is a show that slowly opens up a world of mysteries and a very
            meticulously arranged plan by a villain who’s already dead.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, if you’re looking to watch something that can make you cheerful but eventually sad. Something with
            the classic god-level anime fights as well as moments of deep thought. Naruto is the show for you. If you
            love villains with a reasonable theory and heroes who just won’t give up. This is exactly what you are
            looking for. Naruto was one of the most profitable animes of all time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Masashi Kishimoto, the creator of Naruto, has a net worth of $20 Million. The anime itself earned TV Tokyo
            close to $45 Million between years 2015-2016. In 15 years of publication, the Naruto manga has sold over 220
            million copies. Naruto also has countless games, music releases, events, movies, and now a spin-off. Club
            these up with the manga earnings of $6 Billion and anime sales of $147 Million, and you have the staggering
            figure of close to $10 Billion in revenue. It hardly needs to be said that Naruto is financially very
            profitable. In fact, it was the first anime to make so much money for TV Tokyo, taking the studio to new and
            greater heights.
        </p>
        <p>
            Naruto aired from October 2002 to March 2017. Now it has a spinoff going on called Boruto: Naruto Next
            Generations. This show features Naruto’s son Boruto and, obviously, the new generation of Shinobi.
